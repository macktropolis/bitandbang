Hi, I'm Mack!

# Usage

## npm

```
npx macktropolis
```

## GitHub Package Registry

Assuming you have the GitHub registry set up, you can use via npx:

```
npx @macktropolis/card
```

Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this as a global command. That'd be creepy.
